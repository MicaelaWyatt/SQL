#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1.How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2.How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales 
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE LENGTH(order_id) = 6
AND order_ID <> 'OrderID';

#4.Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT distinct Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6.Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS total_sold, SUM(Quantity)*Price AS revenue, location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum),AVG(FebSales.Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND LENGTH(order_id) = 6
AND order_ID <> 'OrderID';
